      \n\n        \n\n\n\nA lightweight generator for short, unique, non-sequential and decodable Hashids from non-negative numbers.\n\nImplementation of the Hashids algorithm.\n\n\nHashids are obfuscated unique hashes of non-negative (long) integer numbers, but in contrast to cryptographic one-way hash algorithms they are can be decoded again. The algorithm can be used to either generate a hash from a single number or bundling several numbers into one to be stored as simple short UIDs. This design allows to use them for many use-cases like\n\nURL shortening\ndatabase ID protection\nshard numbers storage\ninvitation-, authorization- and gift codes\ncomplex- or clustered system parameters\n\nNumbers like 347 are converted into strings like yr8, or an array of numbers like [27, 986] into 3kTMd.\nFeatures\nThe algorithm provides the following features:\n\nGeneration of short, unique, case-sensitive and non-sequential decodable hashes of natural numbers\nAdditional entropy through salt usage\nConfigurable minimum hash length and alphabet\nCombining of several numbers to one hash\nDeterministic hash computation given the same input and parametrization/instance configuration\nPrevention of curse words through separator characters\n\nIn addition, the library provides features to\n\npass 0x or 0X prefixed hexadecimal numbers to the public API methods\nhandle exceptions instead of returning empty values when invalid parameters are passed to any public API method\ndisable the maximum number size limit which ensures the interoperability with the algorithm reference implementation and allows the usage of the Java Long maximum value\n\n\nPlease note that most features will break the interoperability with the algorithm reference implementation!\n\n\n  Copyright Â© 2017\nArctic Ice Studio\n\n\n\n"},"getting-started/requirements.html":{"url":"getting-started/requirements.html","title":"Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Requirements\nJava\nIceCore Hashids requires Java 8 or higher.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.\nFollowing these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.\nAs for everything else in the project, the contributions to IceCore Hashids are governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior via email.\nGetting Started\nIceCore Hashids is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from the community! There are many ways to contribute, from writing- and improving documentation and tutorials, reporting bugs, submitting enhancement suggestions which can be incorporated into IceCore Hashids itself by submitting a pull request.\nThe project development workflow and process uses GitHub Issues- and Pull Requests management to track issues and pull requests.\nBefore you continue with this contribution guideslines we highly recommend to read the awesome GitHub Open Source Guide on how to making open source contributions.\nBug Reports\nA bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. This section guides you through submitting a bug report for IceCore Hashids. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior and find related reports.\nDo NOT report security vulnerabilities in public issues! Please contact the core team members and the project owner in a responsible manner by email only. We will assess the issue as soon as possible on a best-effort basis and will give you an estimate for when we have a fix and release available for an eventual public disclosure.\n\nUse the GitHub Issues search â check if the issue has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. If you find a closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you are experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.\nCheck if the issue has been fixed â try to reproduce it using the latest version and develop branch in the repository.\nIsolate the problem â ideally create a MCVE.\n\nWhen you are creating a bug report, please provide as much detail and context as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps maintainers to reproduce the problem and resolve issues faster.\n\nUse a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.\nDescribe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.\nInclude screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.\nProvide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you are providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks or attach files to the issue.\n\nIf possible please provide more context by answering these questions:\n\nDid the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of IceCore Hashids) or was this always a problem? If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of IceCore Hashids? What is the most recent version in which the problem does not happen?\nCan you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.\n\nPlease include details about your configuration and environment:\n\nWhat is the version of IceCore Hashids you are using?\nWhat is the name and the version of the OS you're using?\nHave you tried to reproduce it on different OS environments and if yes is the behavior the same for all?\n\n\nWhich Java JDK/JRE distribution and version are you using? (Oracle, OpenJDK, ...)\nAre you running the project with your IDE or Maven?\nAre you using any additional CLI arguments for Java or Maven?\nWhat is the name and the version of the IDE you're using?\n\n\n\nEnhancement Suggestions\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n\nUse the GitHub Issues search â check if this enhancement has already been suggested. If it has and the issue is still open, add your additions as comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\nCheck if the enhancement has already been implemented â use the latest version and develop branch to ensure that the feature or improvement has not already been added.\nProvide a reduced show case â ideally create a MCVE.\n\nBefore creating enhancement suggestions, please check if your idea fits with the scope and provide as much detail and context as possible using a structured layout like the the issue template.\n\nUse a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.\nProvide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible and provide use-cases.\nProvide examples to demonstrate the need of an enhancement. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, use Markdown code blocks or attach files to the issue.\nDescribe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.\nExplain why this enhancement would be useful to most IceCore Hashids users.\nList some other libraries where this enhancement exists.\n\nPull Requests\nThis section guides you through submitting an pull request. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community to better understand your code.\nPlease suggest an enhancement or report a bug first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, fixing a bug), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the core team members and project owner might not want to merge into the project.\nWhen you are submitting an pull request, please provide as much detail and context as possible. Fill out the required template to help maintainers to understand your submitted code.\n\nUse a clear and descriptive title for the pull request\nDo not include issue numbers in the pull request title but fill in the metadata section at the top of the required pull request template making use of the GitHub issue keywords to link to specific enhancement suggestions or bug reports.\nInclude screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the change.\nMake sure to follow the Java and Git commit message style guides.\nRemain focused in scope and avoid to include unrelated commits.\nFeatures and improvements should always be accompanied with tests and documentation. If the pull request improves the performance consider to include a benchmark test, optimally including a chart.\nLint and test before submitting the pull request.\nMake sure to create the pull request from a topic branch.\n\nAll pull requests must be send against the develop branch - Please read the branch organization section below for details about the branching model.\nDocumentations\nIceCore Hashids has two main sets of documentation: the docs and guides, which helps users to learn about the project, and the API, which serves as a reference.\nYou can help improve the docs and guides by making them more coherent, consistent or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, bringing them up to date when there are differences to the latest version. This can be done by submitting a enhancement suggestion and then opening a pull request for it.\nBranch Organization\nThe IceCore Hashids uses the gitflow branching model. The repository consists of two core branches with an infinite development lifecycle:\n\nmaster - The source code of HEAD always reflects a tagged release version.\ndevelop - The default branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest development state.\n\nAll pull requests for the limited development lifecycle story/topic branches must be send against the develop branch.\nHow else can I help?\nImprove Issues\nSome issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid. You can help to make it easier for maintainer to understand and resolve them faster. since handling issues takes a lot of time that could rather spend on writing code.\nGive Feedback On Issues and Pull Requests\nWe're always looking for more opinions on discussions in issues and pull request reviews which is a good opportunity to influence the future direction of IceCore Hashids.\nThe question issue label is a good place to find ongoing discussions and questions.\nStyleguides\nEvery major open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards and conventions for the writing and design of code, documentations and Git commit messages. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.\nA style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community. It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition.\nJava Code Style\nIceCore Hasids adheres to the Arctic Ice Studio Java Style Guide.\n\nGit Commit Messages\nA well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to the maintainers. The code will tell what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell why. Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it as much as possible.\nIceCore Hasids adheres to the Arctic Ice Studio Git Style Guide.\n\nThe style guide assumes that you are familiar with the gitflow branching model.\nMCVE\nA Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example.\nWhen reporting a bug, somtimes even when suggestig a enhancement, the issue can be processed faster if you provide code for reproduction. That code should beâ¦\n\nâ¦Minimal â Use as little code as possible that still produces the same behavior\nâ¦Complete â Provide all parts needed to reproduce the behavior\nâ¦Verifiable â Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the behavior\n\nA MCVE is a common practice like on Stack Overflow and sometimes it is also called SSCCE, a Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example.\nThe recommened way for GitHub based projects is to create it as Gist or new repository, but of course you can attach it to issues and pull requests as files, use any free code paste- or file hosting service or paste the code in Markdown code blocks into the issue.\nMinimal\nThe more code there is to go through, the less likely developers can understand your enhancement or find the bug. Streamline your example in one of two ways:\n\nRestart from scratch. Create new code, adding in only what is needed to demonstrate the behavior and is also useful if you can't post the original code publicly for legal or ethical reasons.\nDivide and conquer. When you have a small amount of code, but the source of the bug is entirely unclear, start removing code a bit at a time until the problem disappears â then add the last part back and document this behavior to help developers to trace- and debug faster.\n\nMinimal and readable\nMinimal does not mean terse â don't sacrifice communication to brevity. Use consistent naming and indentation following the styleguide, and include comments if needed to explain portions of the code.\nComplete\nMake sure all resources and code necessary to reproduce the behavior is included. The problem might not be in the part you suspect it is, but another part entirely.\nVerifiable\nTo entirely understand your enhancement or bug report, developers will need to verify that it exists:\n\nFollow the contribution guidelines regarding the description and details. Without information developers won't be able to understand and reproduce the behavior.\nEliminate any issues that aren't relevant. Ensure that there are no compile-time errors.\nMake sure that the example actually reproduces the problem. Sometimes the bug gets fixed inadvertently or unconsciously while composing the example or does not occur when running on fresh machine environment.\n\nVersioning\nIceCore Hashids follows the Arctic Versioning Specification (ArcVer) which is a lightweight and fully compatible derivative of Semantic Versioning (SemVer). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for enhancements like new features and improvements, and major versions for any backwards incompatible changes. Deprecation warnings are introduced for breaking changes in a minor version so that users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.\nEvery significant change is documented in the changelog.\nCredits\nThanks for the inspirations and attributions to GitHub's Open Source Guides and various contribution guides of large open source projects like Atom, React and Ruby on Rails.\n"},"development/changelog.html":{"url":"development/changelog.html","title":"Changelog","keywords":"","body":"\n\n         \n\n\n0.4.0\n    \nThis version represents a large milestone which is a revise of the whole project to improve the clarity, performance and stability.\n\nDetailed information about each new API feature- and change can be found in the project documentation.\n\nFeatures\nAPI\nâ¯ The public- and internal APIs have been redesigned and rewritten from scratch regarding optimizations for Java 8, reduction of complexity and the new code style guide conventions.\nâ¯ The new com.arcticicestudio.icecore.hashids.HashidsFeature enum contains constants for various features which can be enabled per instance through the Hashids.Builder method features(HashidFeature) : Builder.\nâ¯ The public API now also provides the decodeOne(String) : Optional method to simplify the use-case where the amount of resulting numbers is known before to handle the return value as single value instead of an array. This improves the prevention of an ArrayIndexOutOfBounceException when users try to access an non-existent array index due to an failed encoding- or decoding.\nPublic API Breaking Changes\nâ¯ The obsolete class com.arcticicestudio.icecore.hashids.Hashid has been removed which was previously added to simplify the binding handling of the numbers and their hash value, but users should implement the simple POJO on their own instead of forcing them to use this approach.\nThe public API methods now returning the primitive values which have been hold by the Hashid class. (#9 closed by PR #22, 6d5b21f4)\nâ¯ Due to the removement of the Hashid class some public API methods have become unnecessary and have also been removed. (#9 closed by PR #22, 8e21e96a)\n\ndecodeLongNumbers(String) : long[] - The removed Hashid class has been used as a kind of container to store both the numbers and their associated hash values. This method allowed to directly receive the Long numbers instead of the Hashid POJO which is now be provided by the decode(String) : long[] method.\ndecodeIntegerNumbers(String) : int[] - The algorithm is designed for Long numbers. This method has been implemented to provide an easy conversion interface to use the library with integer IDs which should now be handled by the user.\nencodeToString(long...) : String and encodeToString(int...) : String - These methods are the counterparts for the decoding logic methods described above. Both have been removed for the same reason and the functionality is now available through the encode(String) : long[] method.\n\nâ¯ Removed all overloaded constructors due to the already provided interfaces through the Hashids.Builder class. It provides methods for a accurate instance configuration while an instance with the default interoperable configurations is still available through the default constructor or by using default constructed builder instance. It allows a finer grained instance building since it doesn't depends on parameter ordering. The default constructor is still available for brevity and the functionality of all other removed constructors can now be achieved with the builder. (#9 closed by PR #22, 40231ad1)\nâ¯ The Hashids.Builder method minHashLength(int) : Builder has been renamed to minLength(int) : Builder to adapt to the the builder methods naming style. (#9 closed by PR #22, 8617f4c2)\nâ¯ Separators are not customizable anymore since the curse word protection of the reference algorithm implementation does\nnot allow to modify the separators. The API provided methods to change those separators causing invalid and inconsistent hash- and numbers values. (#9 closed by PR #22, 1a082681)\nInternal API Changes\nâ¯ The private main logic methods doEncode(long...) and doDecode(String, String) have been removed and rewritten from scratch into the associated public API methods. (#9 closed by PR #22)\nâ¯ The private method consistentShuffle(String, String) : String has been rewritten from scratch and renamed to shuffle(char[], char[]) : char[]. (#9 closed by PR #22, 8617f4c2)\nâ¯ The private methods hash(long, String) and unhash(String, String) have been rewritten from scratch and renamed to transform(long, char[], StringBuilder, int) and transform(char[], char\"]). (#9 closed by PR #22, 8617f4c2)\nâ¯ The primary algorithm logic, which was mainly implemented in the private methods doEncode and doDecode, has been rewritten from scratch and modularized into the new methods deriveNewAlphabet(char[], char[], char) : char[] and filterSeparators(char[], char[]) : char[]. (#9 closed by PR #22, 8617f4c2)\nâ¯ The private support methods toArray(List) : long[] and isEmpty(String) : boolean have been removed. (#9 closed by PR #22, 8617f4c2)\nDocumentation\nâ¯ The new project documentation includes detailed information on how to get started, the new API overview and API guide and how to build the project and run the tests. (#11 closed by PR #23)\nâ¯ Next to the project documentation the new GitHub Open Source community standards have been added to complete the project's community profile and adapt to the Open Source Guides consisting of the Contributing Guidelines and the Code of Conduct. (#12 closed by PR #20)\nâ¯ The new GitHub templates providing support for contributors to create issues and submitting pull requests. (#13 closed by PR #19)\nâ¯ To improve the code review process the new GitHub code owner feature has been adapted. (#14 closed by PR #15)\nTests\nAll unit tests have been rewritten from scratch to match the new API and include as much use-cases as possible to increase the code coverage. The new interoperability tests run against the matching version of the reference implementation hashids.js. The script is loaded by using the maven-frontend-plugin which installs NodeJS locally and runs NPM to install all dependencies defined in the package.json. The parameterized InteropHashidsTest class compares the results of both\nalgorithms to ensure interoperability. (#9 closed by PR #22, 8617f4c2)\n\nDetailed information about the functionality and how to run the unit- and interoperability tests can be found in the project documentation.\n\nImprovements\nâ¯ The POM has been refactored to\n\nupdate all plugin- and dependency versions\nremove the unnecessary comment documentation header\nfix the copyright year for generated JavaDoc\nadd the maven-enforcer-plugin\nremove unused profiles and configured core plugins\nremove unused test dependencies\n\n(#17 closed by PR #21)\n0.3.0\n    \nFeatures\nAPI\nâ¯ Implemented a non-parameter constructor as an equivalent to the default Hashids.Builder instance. The builder supports the creation of an Hashids instance without parameters for custom configurations, but there was no equivalent constructor for this case. (#1)\nImprovements\nAPI\nPerformance (Internal)\nâ¯ The private method consistentShuffle(String,String) now uses char arrays instead of String operations. This removes five additional String operations/methods and six String concatenations to three simple array assignments. (#7)\nâ¯ Replaced toCharArray(int) methods with charAt(int) since Strings are implemented as array internally so  there is no need to convert to a char array.\nâ¯ Adapted to SonarQube minor rule squid:S3400. (#5)\nâ¯ Adapted to SonarQube minor rule squid:S3400 to improve the performance. (#6)\nDocumentation\nâ¯ Adapted to a new project setup and documentation style. (#2)\nTests\nâ¯ Slighly increased the code coverage by implementation unit tests for the Hashid equals symmetric. (#8)\nBug Fixes\nAPI\nâ¯ Fixed a ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when using a invalid decode salt.\nJavaDoc\nâ¯ Fixed JavaDoc lint compilation errors for self-closed tags. (#3)\n0.2.0\n  \nFeatures\nAPI\nâ¯ Implemented the public API method getVersion(String) to get the version.\nImprovements\nAPI\nâ¯ Now using StringBuilder for non-constant String attributes to avoid unnecessary String primitive-wrapping\nâ¯ No more boxing of primitive for String conversion only. Make use of the static JDK method + String.valueOf(char):String to avoid waste of memory and cycles by not using a primitive-wrapper with concatenating empty string \"\" to a primitive. This change fulfills the Eclipse SonarQube rule squid:S2131:\n\nPrimitives should not be boxed just for String conversion\n\nâ¯ Changed private methods without access to instance data to be static. Clarifies that these methods will not modify the state of the object. This change fulfills the Eclipse SonarQube rule squid:S2325:\n\nPrivate methods that don't access instance data should be static\n\nâ¯ Pre-compile regex Pattern pattern. Improves the performance (less memory and CPU cycles) by using pre-compiled regex pattern instead of creating instances for each Pattern call.\n0.1.0\n  \nFeatures\nAPI\nâ¯ Implemented the public API. The Hashids.Builder class configures Hashids default instances. To create instances with custom configurations either the parameterized constructors can be used or by using the instance builder methods\n\nsalt(String)\nalphabet(String)\nminHashLength(int)\nbuild(int)\n\nTo encode numbers and decode hashes the following public API methods have been implemented:\n\nencode(long...) : Hashid - Encode number(s)\nencodeToString(long...):String - Encode number(s) to string. |\nencodeToString(int...):String | Encode number(s) to string. |\nencodeHex(String):String | Encode an hexadecimal string to string. |\ndecode(String):Hashid | Decode an encoded string. |\ndecodeLongNumbers(String):long[] | Decode an encoded string to long numbers. |\ndecodeIntegerNumbers(String):int[] | Decode an encoded string to integer numbers. |\ndecodeHex(String):String | Decode an string to hexadecimal numbers. |\n\nDocumentation\nâ¯ Added a usage guide for the API. This includes all currently implemented public API methods and general notes to the library algorithm.\nTests\nâ¯ Implemented unit tests for the public- and internal API.\nProject Initialization\nDate: 2016-06-04\n"},"development/code-of-conduct.html":{"url":"development/code-of-conduct.html","title":"Code of Conduct","keywords":"","body":"Code of Conduct\nAll members, committers and volunteers in this project are required to act according to the following Code of Conduct.
